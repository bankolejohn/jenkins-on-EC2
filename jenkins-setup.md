The first you need to do as a user is to creat a job to automate your applications workflow

For example, a java application:
- Build with Maven
- Run tests
- Build Jar file
To achieve this with Jenkis, Maven needs to be available on Jenkins

or For Javascript Application
- Node App
- Run tests
- Package and push to Repo

to achieve this with Jenkins, npm needs to be available on Jenkins

So, depending on your application or programming language, you need to have different tools installed and configured on Jenkins

2 ways to install and configure tools
- install plugins via the jenkins UI
- install tools directly on remote server
